# hello_world

This hello_world project is my own idea of having a very simple flutter project that cover the possible best practices:
- Unit Test
- Widget Test
- Integration Test
- CI
- CD
- Monitoring

## How To Execute Test Locally

This project comes with tests that cover from unit test, widget test, and integration test

### Unit Test

```
$ flutter test test/hello_test.dart
```

### Widget Test

```
$ flutter clean
$ flutter pub get
$ flutter test test/widget_test.dart
```
